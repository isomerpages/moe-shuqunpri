<h4>2. Seh-Chuan Shuqun Alumni Association</h4>
<div>
<p>In 2005, our Ex-Principal, Mr Gary Tsu initiated the idea of starting an alumni association. After a year of planning, we finally launched our&nbsp;Seh-Chuan Shuqun Alumni Association during our 83rd Anniversary. This was the first ever- grand occasion held in our school compound after we had shifted into our new premises.</p>
<p>Following this, we collaborated with Shuqun Secondary School in 2010 to organize another big-scale event to celebrate the school&rsquo;s 85th&nbsp;Anniversary at Orchid Country Club. It turned up to be a joyous and memorable function which was well attended by many former students and staff of the school.</p>
<p>Other events included a gathering at the old Seh-Chuan School building. It was publicized in the papers and websites. Brochures were sent out and banners&nbsp;promoting the event were hung outside both schools. It was successfully attended by many ex-shuqunites. Indeed, it brought back the good old days when they&nbsp;were students and staff at the old school compound. The nostalgic feelings sent tears of happiness down the cheeks of many and laughter filled that building.&nbsp;Everyone mingled around, chatted with one another and viewed old-times photos. All had so much to talk about those days.</p>
<p>Do you miss the times you had in Shuqun Primary School? Do you miss the teachers who had given you your favourite Children&rsquo;s Day gift or the teacher&nbsp;who used to detain you in school? Or do you miss catching up with some friends who had gone separate ways after PSLE?</p>
<p>Come and join us and be on our Alumni mailing list. We will keep you posted of up and coming events.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact&nbsp;Miss Zeng Yingxu&nbsp;@ 65637129.&nbsp;</p>
