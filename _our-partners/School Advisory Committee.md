<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Shuqun Primary School Advisory Committee (SAC) was formed about the same time Shuqun Primary School was reconstituted into&nbsp;a government school from a Government-Aided School in 1984. Prior to that, Shuqun (previously known as Seh Chuan) was governed by&nbsp;a school management board. The SAC was formed for the following functions:</span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To promote closer relationship in various ways, between members of the local community and the principals, teachers and students&nbsp;in Government schools</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To provide opportunities for the local community to take an interest in student welfare and encourage students co-curricular&nbsp;activities aimed at character development and their overall growth in lines with the Desired Outcomes of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The SAC is a key pillar of the school with influence that has spanned more than 20 years of the school&rsquo;s history. Apart from being&nbsp;the tacit source of knowledge for the school&rsquo;s history since moving to Jurong West, the SAC saw through the transitions of school leadership&nbsp;over 5 principals. The committee played a key role in almost every fund-raising exercise for the school including 2003 where $137,000 was&nbsp;paid out of funds raised for the school upgrading under PRIME. They continue to help the school raise funds as and when the need arises,&nbsp;such as for the 85th Anniversary celebrations in 2010. They have also donated items like the grand piano in the school hall, as well as&nbsp;sponsored our school&rsquo;s Teacher&rsquo;s Day celebrations. In addition, the SAC also sponsors annual achievement awards for the outstanding students&nbsp;of the school. The members of the SAC were also Guests-of-honour and VIPs invited to support school events like Lunar New Year celebrations,&nbsp;Sports Day as well as Speech &amp; Prize Giving Day. In addition, the SAC also sponsors annual achievement awards for the outstanding&nbsp;students of the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Currently, our SAC comprises community leaders, grassroots leaders, professionals and alumni. Some of them have served the school for many years and were appointed by the SAC to the position of Patrons of the School. This is in view of their tirelessly service and support for our school.</span></p>
