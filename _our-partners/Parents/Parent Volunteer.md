<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Parent Volunteer Scheme</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">Apart from joining the Parent Support Group, parents can also volunteer in the school as part of MOE’s Primary One (P1) Phase 2B Registration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">Under the ruling of MOE Primary One P1 Registration Exercise, a parent can volunteer in the school to qualify for Phase 2B if the child is a Singapore citizen or a Permanent Resident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">The registration stage for a child whose parent would like to join the school as a parent volunteer is between 1 April and 30 June of the year preceding the P1 registration year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">The parent has to complete at least 40 hours of voluntary service from 1 July of the preceding year to 30 June in the P1 registration year. After the 40 hours of voluntary service is performed, the child will be eligible for the phase 2B registration exercise. Please note that being a parent volunteer does not guarantee your child a place in the school.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">MOE P1 registration consists of Phase 1, 2A, 2B, 2C and 2C Supplementary.&nbsp; For Phase 2B, there is a minimum of 20 reserved places. In addition to the reserved places, one-third of remaining vacancies after Phase 2A will be allocated to Phase 2B, and two-thirds will be allocated to Phase 2C. In the event when there are more parent volunteers than allocated vacancies in Phase 2B, balloting will be carried out to allocate these vacancies to ensure fairness. Singapore citizens will be given priority should balloting be required.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">Please refer to MOE website for more details regarding the P1 Registration processes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">If you are interested in signing up as a parent volunteer, please complete the Parent Volunteers Registration Form and submit it with the copies of the relevant documents to the school office.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">Successful applicants will be informed through the main applicant’s email. Do ensure that the email is valid and legibly filled in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">The school has the sole discretion in the selection of Parent Volunteers. We seek your understanding that the school will not be able to share with you the reason for non-selection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 12.0pt 0cm;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">The deployment of parent volunteers in the school is dependent on the school needs. This would be arranged with the parents with sufficient notice given each time before their services are required.</span></p>
