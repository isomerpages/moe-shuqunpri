<p>The original African proverb might have been &ldquo;It takes a village to raise a child&rdquo; and here in Shuqun, we recognise the importance of partnering parents to create a &ldquo;village&rdquo; that engages the wider community.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shuqun Parenting Education Conference (SPEC)</strong></span></h3>
<p>Over the years, teachers have been developing lesson videos created for parents to try out the various strategies with their child at home. SPEC was shifted online for parents&rsquo; ease of use and convenience. In 2023, SPEC has evolved from focusing only on academic subjects to covering non-academic subjects such as PE, Art, Music, and Cyber Wellness.</p>
