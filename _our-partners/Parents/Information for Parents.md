<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Mission</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The original African proverb might have been &ldquo;It takes a village to raise a child&rdquo; and here in Shuqun, we recognise the importance of partnering parents to create a &ldquo;village&rdquo; that engages the wider community.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Shuqun Parenting Education Conference (SPEC)</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years, teachers have been developing lesson videos created for parents to try out the various strategies with their child at home. SPEC was shifted online for parents&rsquo; ease of use and convenience. In 2023, SPEC has evolved from focusing only on academic subjects to covering non-academic subjects such as PE, Art, Music, and Cyber Wellness.</span></p>
