<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Objectives</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our school acknowledges the value of a strong school-parent partnership in enhancing the holistic development and learning of our students. SQPSG was formed to foster a closer communication and understanding between our school and families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mission:</strong> Support the school and enrich the school life of our students</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vision:</strong> Forge a strong partnership between school and parents</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Motto:</strong> Serve with ICARE (Integrity, Care, Adaptability, Respect and Excellence)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As our partners-in-education, the SQPSG supports the school&rsquo;s vision in developing our students to be Engaged Learners, Rooted in Values, and With a Heart to Serve. SQPSG collaborates actively with the school in the various activities and events to create a vibrant environment that enhances the holistic school experience of students. Such activities and events include:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTL Fortnight)</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of our MTL Fortnight, the P1 and P2 students had the opportunity to have their iPad Trail, focusing on traditional music and songs. A group of our PSG members volunteered their time with assisting teachers in the students&rsquo; discipline and safety during the iPad Trail.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P1 &amp; P2 Learning Journeys</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the P1 and P2 learning journeys to Jacob Ballas Garden and Harmony in Diversity Gallery respectively, our PSG members went along and assisted the teachers in chaperoning the students around the locations.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebration</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to Teachers&rsquo; Day, our PSG members came on a Saturday to volunteer their expertise and artistic talents in decorating the hall and stage in line with the Kampung theme.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Children&rsquo;s Day Celebration</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To embrace the new normal after the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to learn the values from the different characters we meet in real life and in fantasy books, the PSG dressed up as characters from books and prepared craft activities and game booths in a carnival-style Children&rsquo;s Day celebration.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P1 2023 Orientation</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After sharing with the P1 2023 parents on how the PSG complements the school by aligning programmes and activities with the school&rsquo;s objectives to improve the students&rsquo; well-being and learning, the PSG EXCO members held a recruitment drive for parents to join SQPSG in 2023.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P6 BizKids</strong></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PSG had set up a booth selling things items such as bookmarks and bags from upcycled materials to encourage sustainable living. They also created games to educate students on the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>P1 First Day of School</strong></h4>

![](/images/Psg007.jpg)
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the first day of school for the Primary 1 students, PSG EXCO members were given the opportunity to helm the engagement session with parents, sharing on tips and their experiences setting routines with their children. This sharing was beneficial as they also shared on the importance of executive functioning skills in children.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chinese New Year Decoration</strong></h4>

![](/images/Psg008.jpg)
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Chinese New Year, PSG members volunteered their time and effort in decorating the school. Some had even stayed back to do a few bunny standees from scratch, to beautify the hall entrance.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Total Defence Day Commemoration</strong></h4>

![](/images/Psg009.jpg)
<p style="text-align: justify;">To commemorate Total Defence Day, we had PSG parents who took time to share with students on their respective careers and how their jobs contribute to the six TDD pillars. The P4 to P6 students had the chance to hear the sharing as part of their Education &amp; Career Guidance journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These programmes and activities would not be possible without the Executive Committee (EXCO), that constantly helps to oversee all PSG efforts and is the main point of contact with the school staff.</p>
