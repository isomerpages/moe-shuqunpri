<h4><strong>China</strong></h4>
<p>a)&nbsp;<u>Wuxi Jinqiao Bilingual Experimental School</u><u></u></p>
<p>This collaboration consists of students having lesson immersion in one another&rsquo;s school. The main focus is on Chinese Language though Shuqun Primary is also exploring the focus in the area of Mathematics. For the SAP programme, our students will get to be involved in learning journeys to places of interest around the Jiangsu province.</p>
<h4><strong>Hong Kong</strong></h4>
<p>Besides hosting both schools at different times of the year, our SAP programme consists of a combined 1-week visit to both schools stated. Besides lesson immersion at the respective schools, students will also experience a homestay programme whereby they have an opportunity to reside with local families and thus immerse in the culture of the residents. They will also get to embark on learning trails and visit places of interest in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><u>St Francis of Assissi&rsquo;s English Primary School</u></p>
<p>Students will experience a few days of lesson immersion and involve in a homestay programme with the locals. Our students will experience the talent development programme that the school has structured for themselves.</p>
