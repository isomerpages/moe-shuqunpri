FFTH is a non-profit organisation that feeds the needy through its food distribution programme. The school has collaborated with FFTH for many years in implementing the following outreach programmes:

School Goodie Bag – The focus is on providing selected FAS students, with positive attitude in school and have regular attendance, and their families with healthier food rations monthly to support them through a key stage of their lives.

Food Donation Drive – The school adopts this donation drive as part of our service to the community. Annually the school organizes a food donation drive to collect food items, which will be delivered to the Food from the Heart warehouse and included in FFTH’s food packs to the needy.

Clean Plate Campaign – The school partners with FFTH for this campaign during Youth for Environment Day (YED) to emphasise the importance of reducing food waste by creating awareness of the environmental and societal impact of food waste and instilling the habit of mindful eating. To reduce the amount of food wastage nationally, Food from the Heart advocates ending each meal with a clean plate.
