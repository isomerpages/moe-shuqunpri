<p>The school collaborates with Jurong Spring Community Club in a number of outreach events. The beautiful mural paintings that Shuqun Primary School did, at the void deck of Blk 511 Jurong West St 51, provides a showcase for our artistic talent, whilst at the same time providing a vibrancy to the neighbourhood. In addition the school visit Jurong Central NTUC Eldercare regularly. Not only do we provide company, various activities are done to engage the elderly e.g. performances, making simple handicrafts and provide other forms of entertainment.</p>

<p>There are other Values-In-Action activities like litter-picking around the neighbourhood and further engagement is made with the residents with the students performing during Mid-Autumn Festival and other events organised by the CC.</p>

<p>Shuqun Primary School has been partnering Loving Heart Multi Service Centre (LHMSC) for many years. LHMSC is a voluntary welfare organization which provides a one-stop social service centre. The organisation undertakes social projects within the area and collaborates with relevant organizations to better serve the community. Many of our students have benefitted from their programmes. One such programme is the Pupil Breakfast Scheme (PBS) has provided breakfast for some of our students from lower income families. Besides that, the Sports-Tuition-And-Mentoring Programme (STAMP) programme has positively impacted the lives of some of our students.</p>

<p>In return the school has helped LHMSC in their annual fundraising efforts. There is active participation by both staff and students as the funds raised will assist LHMSC in running activities that are beneficial to the residents such as PBS, STAMP, Free Tuition Service for Needy Students, Food Gift Service to Needy Families/ Residents, Free Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinic, Project Home Sweet Home (House Cleaning Service), Family Life Circle Programme and Adopt-A-Home.</p>

<p>The school also partners with Food from the Heart, a non-profit organisation, in their food goodie bag programme whereby they will provide non-perishable food items, such as rice, cooking oil, biscuits, beverages and canned food, to identified needy pupils monthly. The students identified must show positive attitude to school and have regular attendance. The aim is to provide relief to needy school children and their families by providing them sufficient nutrition.</p>
