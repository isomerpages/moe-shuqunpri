In the midst of managing COVID-19 and witnessing the many changes to our lives, we decided to review what we stand for as a school in 2021.

Much of our vision – building a vibrant learning community and being rooted in values remain relevant to us.  To create a learner-centred environment by enhancing our learning spaces and the way we teach is what we have always striven for. Our moral imperative to anchor our Shuqunites in our school values remains steadfast.  Our embarking on Positive Education has opened up new possibilities to enable our Shuqunites to put our school values into practice.  Similarly, the aspiration to nurture the star in every Shuqunite as our mission still resonates with us.   We believe that our Shuqunites are gifted in different ways and hence it is our honour and responsibility to nurture the innate abilities and talents waiting to be discovered in our students and staff.

What has changed in our vision and mission is our desire to nurture in our Shuqunites a spirit to use their talents and abilities to benefit others around them.  COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of community and looking out for those less fortunate than ourselves in a myriad of ways.  It could be an encouraging word, a note of gratitude or an offer of assistance.  We hope to instil in our Shuqunites that no gesture of kindness and understanding is too small or insignificant.

As a school, we would like to challenge ourselves to go beyond providing our Shuqunites opportunities to contribute positively.  To nurture “a heart to serve”, we aim to grow in them an awareness of community needs and a desire to put their empathy into action by tapping on their unique talents and abilities.

To enable our Shuqunites to understand that they are never too young to contribute would require the continued support of our stakeholders.  We look forward to working with all, invested to bring out the best in our students.  With your continued confidence and belief in what we strive for, we look forward to enabling our students to flourish as individuals of distinction and character.
