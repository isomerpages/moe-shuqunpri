<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I sometimes wonder, when the magnanimous founders of our school, set out to establish Tuan Cheng Public School, whether they envisioned the day that the school would celebrate its centennial.&nbsp; Our founders’ efforts certainly echo Guan Zhong’s quote aptly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is certainly no mean feat to be still functioning as a school a century later.&nbsp; We have experienced, weathered and thrived through many global events and phenomena – from World War 2 to the withdrawal of the British forces from Singapore to separation from Malaysia as well as to 21<sup>st</sup> Century developments such as the rise of the Internet and AI and the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; This is but a drop in the ocean in terms of developments on the national and global stages.&nbsp; Guided by the Ministry of Education’s directions and spurred on by the generous support of the community, the school has transformed and even reinvented herself to changing trends and developments through these 10 decades.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At Shuqun Primary School, we strive to provide a holistic education for her students, fondly referred to as Shuqunites. Beyond building a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy, we believe in discovering and nurturing the ‘star’ in every Shuqunite—whether in the academics, the arts, sports or leadership. Our curriculum is designed to offer diverse opportunities for students to explore their talents, build character, and develop a love for learning.&nbsp; As a school, we are aware that the world can indeed be our classroom and we hope that we can reach out to more alumni and invested stakeholders to partner us in enriching the learning experiences of our students.&nbsp; By so doing, we believe that we do justice to the legacy our founders set out for us 100 years ago - &nbsp;<strong>莫如树人</strong><strong>~ to educate people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Shuqun Primary School would not be here today if it weren’t for the hard and ‘heart’ work of countless generations of staff, alumni and well-wishers.&nbsp; Together we continue to strive to realise the potential in our students.&nbsp; Of equal importance is that fact that we want to ensure that our students are grounded in our values and know that as they have received and benefitted, they have a responsibility to contribute back to society.&nbsp; &nbsp;To this end “Heart to Serve” initiatives are planned and rolled out for cohorts and selected groups; in kind and in effort; within school and with the support of important partners such as our Parents’ Support Group and the community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we carry the torch into the next century, our wish is for all invested in the school to be inspired by and committed to our founders’ aspirations to nurture young men and women of quality and distinction.&nbsp; We once again invite you to partner us in our efforts to bring up wholesome students who are a credit to themselves, their families and the community.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yours in partnership,</span></p>
