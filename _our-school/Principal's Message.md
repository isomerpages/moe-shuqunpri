<p>2025 is memorable not only because it marked our nation’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday, but also because Shuqun Primary School celebrated its centennial, quite a milestone for a primary school.&nbsp; It was a year replete with many memorable moments, in particular, our 3 public-facing events namely our Homecoming Carnival, our Gala Dinner and our National Day outreach to Jurong Spring CC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highlighted these 3 events because they encapsulate what we strive to uphold in our school.&nbsp; Through the Carnival and the Dinner, we were able to showcase our holistic approach to education.&nbsp; We have made credible strides in our niche areas of Environmental Education and Outdoor Education and these were creatively featured during the Carnival.&nbsp; Similarly, we see our Shuqunites growing in confidence as Student Leaders and they did themselves proud as docents and hosts during these 2 events.&nbsp; The Jurong Spring CC outreach is noteworthy because of our genesis.&nbsp; 100 years ago, a team of civic-minded and compassionate founders set up our school to provide the children of the Jurong Kechil community a chance to receive an education.&nbsp; Over the years, our school has weathered storms such as World War 2 and adapted to changes as the education landscape morphed.&nbsp; Shuqun Primary School is indeed a school built by the community for the community.&nbsp; Hence in being able to collaborate with Jurong Spring CC in collecting and distributing food bags for 200 beneficiaries on August 2 this year, we are not only living up to our mission to cultivate in our Shuqunites a heart to serve but also honouring our founders’ legacy to live for others.</p>
<p>Moving forward we will continue to strive to discover the stars in our Shuqunites, be they in the sports, the arts, the academics or in leadership.&nbsp; As a staff, we continue to work on our talent development efforts to surface these talents; find opportunities to showcase them and stretch the potential of these budding stars in competitions and in community outreach platforms.&nbsp; Undergirding our efforts would be our emphasis on values education, to enable our Shuqunities to stay grounded; make good decisions; be grateful and be willing and able to contribute to the community through their talents and abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, we continue to look for support from our parents, alumni, SAC and community.&nbsp; Their unstinting support for our 100<sup>th</sup> Anniversary celebrations was truly heartening and a&nbsp; testimony to their faith and belief in what Shuqun Primary School strives to achieve.&nbsp; We do not take this confidence in us for granted and will strive to strengthen and enhance such partnerships to benefit our Shuqunites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To end, I would like to recall the theme of our Gala Dinner which summarises our raison d’etre and continues as our clarion call:</p>
<p><strong>树茂根深</strong> <strong>群贤毕至</strong></p>
<p><strong>树茂根深</strong> translated refers to a person or an organisation with a solid foundation and strong capabilities. This idiom is often used to describe individuals with a rich background who can endure various tests, possess perseverance and have long-term potential for development.</p>
<p>Whilst <strong>群贤毕至</strong>refers to the gathering of talented and capable individuals in one place.</p>
<p>Guided by this theme, we will continue to explore ways to enable our students to embrace lifelong learning; appreciate that it takes a village to raise a child and have the pay it forward mindset to benefit others as they have benefited themselves.</p>

<p>Yours in partnership,</p>
