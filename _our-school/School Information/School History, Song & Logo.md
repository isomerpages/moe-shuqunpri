**Shuqun Primary School** started in 1925 and was known as Tuan Cheng Public School. Later it became known as Seh Chuan High School. It was situated off Jalan Jurong Kechil.

In April 1983, Seh Chuan High School changed from an aided to a government school bearing the hanyu pinyin name of Shuqun Secondary School. In April 1984, the primary section ceased to function as part of the secondary school and became known as **Shuqun Primary School**.

In June 1986, headed by Mr Tear Ee Soon, Shuqun Primary School shifted to its present site with an enrolment of 533 pupils and 17 teachers.
