<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Our Vision</span></strong></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Our curriculum is designed by MOE's curriculum specialists and is based on the Nurturing Early Learners Framework which guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With a well-designed physical environment and through our two flagship programmes - the HI-Light programme and the Starlight Literacy programme, your child will engage in authentic learning experiences.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Our Beliefs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">At MOE Kindergarten (MK), we believe that children are curious, active, and competent learners.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Children are curious learners</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">They have an innate sense of curiosity that should be nurtured. They wonder, question, explore and seek to make sense and meaning of their world. By acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover and learn more.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Children are active learners</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">They learn by doing. They are also more likely to understand and remember skills and concepts learnt through participation, exploration and experimentation involving real-life objects and experiences.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Children are competent learners</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Their thinking and reasoning skills evolve over time as they build new knowledge upon their existing knowledge and experiences. Through constantly thinking and reflecting about their learning, children deepen their understanding of how the world works.</span></p>
