<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Starlight Literacy Programme</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Early Childhood Literacy</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children&rsquo;s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children&rsquo;s interest in learning languages.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We will use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese, Malay or Tamil language).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Communicate with confidence.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Learn about local customs and traditions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MTL and bilingualism</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore&rsquo;s education system. Learning our MTL gives us direct access to our cultural heritage, and can help us better understand our values, roots and identities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At MK, we nurture bilingualism by focusing on listening, speaking and engaging children in games and activities that encourage early literacy development.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them for language learning in later years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Weeks of Wonder (WoW Project)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a&nbsp;<strong>Weeks of Wonder (WoW) project</strong>. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another 2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with their friends on a topic of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Through WoW projects, children learn how to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Make their own decisions.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Develop problem-solving, process and investigative skills.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Collaborate with one another.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Communicate effectively in English and their MTL.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects allow children to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Experience the joy of self-motivated learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Build their confidence.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning.</span></li>
</ul>
