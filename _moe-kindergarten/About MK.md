We are excited to share with you that MOE Kindergarten at Shuqun (MK@SQPS) has commenced operation from January 2023.

MOE has been running MKs since 2014 to provide A Strong Start for Every Child. The MK Curriculum nurtures children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. The feedback from the parents of MK children has been consistently positive, affirming that their children have the confidence and social skills to adapt to Primary 1.

The siting of an MK in our school will offer enriched learning experiences for the school community. Our students will develop social and interpersonal skills by participating in joint activities with the younger children. These joint activities are also opportunities for our students to showcase their learning to the kindergarten children and to exercise their leadership skills when they guide the younger children. Our school teachers will also benefit from a mutual understanding of educational programmes in the MK and primary schools.

The MOE Kindergarten online registration exercise for 2023 K1 admission is closed. Parents who have missed the registration exercise and would like to apply for MOE Kindergarten at Shuqun Primary, please submit the Waitlist Application and supporting documents via: [MOE Kindergarten Waitlist Application 2023](https://www.form.gov.sg/63dcd639dd51570011a2d87a).

The online registration exercise for Early Years Centre (EYC) and Open Admissions (OA) will open from **9am on Friday, 17 February 2023 and close at 4pm on Tuesday, 21 February 2023**.
