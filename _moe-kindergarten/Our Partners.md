### Kindergarten Care

We offer Kindergarten Care (KCare), a full day childcare programme, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

If you register, your child will be in KCare before and after your elected MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service.

### Early Years Centre (EYC)

We partner with PCF Sparkletots in an MK â€“ Early Years Centre (EYC) pilot model.

This partnership guarantees a Kindergarten 1 placement (when your child turns five years old) in our MK.
