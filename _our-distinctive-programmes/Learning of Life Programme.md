<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Character and Leadership development through ADventure (CLAD)</strong></span></h3>
<p>We aim to develop the students&rsquo; character and leadership through outdoor education. Outdoor Education in SQPS engages the students&rsquo; spirit of adventure through the exploration of natural and urban environments.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Shuqun Primary School&rsquo;s objectives for LLP are:</strong></span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Provide students with opportunities to develop and apply outdoor skills in an authentic environment.</li>
<li>Train and empower students with the skills and aptitudes to lead and advocate for OE and Environmental Education.</li>
<li>Develop character and leadership skills of students through adventure, in line with the 21st Century Competencies.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>OE Framework</strong></span></h3>

<p>The framework for Outdoor Education in SQPS is based on the 3Ls of&nbsp;<strong>Learn, Live</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Lead. </strong></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Learning Stage</strong></span></h4>
<p>At the learning stage, students learn specific outdoor and life skills through a spiral approach. OE skills are taught explicitly in Physical Education lessons for Primary 1 to 6 students and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for Primary 1 and 2 students. The values and skills learnt in this stage form the building blocks for the next stage of the students&rsquo; OE experience.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Living Stage</strong></span></h4>
<p>In the living stage, students apply their learning in authentic outdoor situations as they participate in OE activities beyond the school environment. At camps, students would learn to manage themselves and work with others.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Leading Stage</strong></span></h4>
<p>Students with a keen interest and aptitude in OE are further stretched at the leading stage. They become more skillful and can advocate for outdoor education and environmental efforts. Students may have the opportunity to participate in competitions and the LEADEx programme where their character and leadership skills are further honed through outdoor adventure activities.</p>
