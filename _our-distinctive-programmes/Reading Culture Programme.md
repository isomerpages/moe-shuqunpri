<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Developing a Reading Culture Programme</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The school has embarked on a whole school approach to prepare students to be proficient readers by developing in them a passion to read and also teaching them how to read. Students will be taught to select books that cater to their age and interest levels. Programmes and activities have been planned to build a reading culture that develops students into avid readers:</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reading Period</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">One period per week is set aside for reading where students engage in book exploration &amp; extension activities. The aim is to allow students to spend time on leisure reading &amp; encourage them to read more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Positive reading experiences are provided through activities such as book talks, storytelling sessions and providing incentives for good readers.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reading Activity Programme</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The EL and MT departments have a Reading Activity Programme to promote the reading of both EL and MT books with a combined rewards and recognition system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is a Reading Activity Booklet each for Lower Primary (P1-2), Middle Primary (P3-4) and Upper Primary (P5-6). Each booklet comprises a number of reading activities to be completed by students over the course of a year.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Read@School Project in collaboration with National Library Board (NLB)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The school has been working with NLB since 2014 to carry out a series of reading activities with the aim to nurture readers in our students. There are assembly programmes such as Book Buzz to promote books appropriate for students and storytelling.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reading Events</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Parent-Child Reading sessions have been organised since 2015. 2017 saw the event on its largest scale ever with it being offered to P1-4 parents and students. The event was well-received by parents who appreciated the opportunity to learn useful and interesting strategies from the teachers who conducted the reading activities. They also discovered different ways to get their children to develop an interest in reading, learnt more about their children&rsquo;s reading interests and skills and increased bonding time with their children through the reading activities.</span></p>
