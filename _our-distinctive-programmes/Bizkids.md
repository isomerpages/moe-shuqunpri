<h3><span style="color: #a11104;">Objectives</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Educate students on the importance of giving back to the community with a heart</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Inculcate the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship through fund-raising event</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Provide a platform for students to carry out activities to promote environment sustainability</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bizkids is a special programme designed for our graduating classes, aiming to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit within them. Our Primary 6 students go through a series of enrichment sessions after PSLE, where they are taught entrepreneurial skills like budgeting and marketing. Coupled with enrichment programmes like public speaking and financial literacy in the earlier levels, our Primary 6 students will put into practice what they have learnt. Each class will design games or create unique, handcrafted products which they would carry out promotional activities for, before making them available for sale to the school community during the annual fundraising event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bizkids gives our students an opportunity to contribute to society through the fundraising event that involves the rest of the student masses. Over the years, charities that have benefitted from our Bizkids fundraising activities include Acres, SPCA, Children&rsquo;s Society and Grounds-Up Initiative (GUI). We hope, through this, that our students will be actively involved in learning to appreciate and develop their sense of commitment to the community and be encouraged to play their part to make it a better place to be in.</span></p>
