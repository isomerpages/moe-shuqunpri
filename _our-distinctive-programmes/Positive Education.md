<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Objectives</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Shuqun Primary School, Positive Education is integrated into character development and well-being which are important components of learning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leveraging Positive Education, Shuqunites realise their own abilities and are able to cope with the normal stresses of life; work productively and fruitfully and contribute to the community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school began its Positive Education journey in 2018 and adopted PROSPER (i.e., Positivity, Relationships, Outcomes, Strengths, Purpose, Engagement, and Resilience) as the framework. Different aspects of the framework are emphasized and implemented in school initiatives to enhance student well-being.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>P</strong>ROSPER - Positivity</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students have been taught the importance of having a Growth Mindset and the &lsquo;Power of Yet&rsquo; in their learning. There are many opportunities for students to practise Growth Mindset in their daily learning both in school and at home.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">P<strong>R</strong>OSPER &ndash; Relationships</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To establish positive relationships, students are taught how to be a peer supporter to their classmates, offering their help or a listening ear when the need arises. Teachers reinforce socio-emotional learning skills with the students to strengthen their intra- and inter-personal skills.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">PR<strong>O</strong>SPER &ndash; Outcomes</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gratitude is an important dimension to healthy relationships and personal well-being. Hence the school creates occasions to enable Shuqunites to display their appreciation of the efforts of the different members of staff in the school. One such example is the Non-Teaching Staff (NTS) Appreciation Week.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">PRO<strong>S</strong>PER<strong> &ndash; Strengths</strong></span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that every Shuqunite has unique strengths and talents waiting to be discovered and developed. Through Student-Teacher Contact Time, Form Teachers establish rapport with their students, so as to understand, acknowledge and nurture the strengths of their students. Students are given opportunities to showcase their talents through their participation in school events, such as taking part in competitions and putting up performances for the school and the community.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">PROS<strong>P</strong>ER &ndash; Purpose</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that all Shuqunites are potential leaders. Thus, students are trained in the Leadership Challenge principles and provided opportunities to serve and lead others. Shuqunites may serve in the capacity of Ambassadors, Co-Curricular Activities Leaders and Student Councillors. We strive to help our student leaders appreciate the joy of serving and the need to be concerned and proactive members of the community, where no contribution is too insignificant.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">PROSP<strong>E</strong>R &ndash; Engagement</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our staff engage in professional development so as to enrich the learning environment for their students. Whether it be in the area of content delivery, pedagogies employed or experiences curated, our teachers work collectively to provide a positive and safe learning environment for our students to thrive as learners.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">PROSPE<strong>R</strong> &ndash; Resilience</span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Resilience, an invaluable trait to enable our Shuqunites to bounce back from setbacks; act with courage; make good decisions and exercise self-management. While not explicitly taught as a concept, the teachers capitalise on &lsquo;teachable moments&rsquo; where resilience is required or demonstrated for reinforcement of the value.</p>
