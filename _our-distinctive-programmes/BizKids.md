<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Objectives</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BizKids is a special programme designed for our graduating classes, aiming to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit within them. Our Primary 6 students go through a series of enrichment sessions after PSLE, where they are taught entrepreneurial skills like budgeting and marketing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Coupled with enrichment programmes like public speaking and financial literacy in the earlier levels, our Primary 6 students put into practice what they have learnt. Each class designs games or creates unique, handcrafted products which they would carry out promotional activities for, before making them available for sale to the school community during the annual fundraising event.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the COVID pandemic when face-to-face interaction was greatly reduced, thestudents acquired additional skills in carrying out their sales online. They were able to put up videos on the objects for sale; collate online orders before producing the items on demand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">BizKids gives our students an opportunity to contribute to society through the fundraising event that involves the rest of the student population. Over the years, charities that have benefitted from our BizKids fundraising activities include Acres, SPCA, Children&rsquo;s Society and Grounds-Up Initiative (GUI).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We hope, through this, that our students will be actively involved in learning to </span><span style="color: #000000;">appreciate and develop their sense of commitment to the community and be encouraged to play their part to make it a better place to be in.</span></p>
