<h4><strong>Student Ambassador Programme (Outbound and Friends4life)</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Outbound</strong></h4>

<p>With the fast pace of globalization, it is essential for us to prepare our students not only to be connected global citizens, but also knowledgeable rooted Singaporeans. The Student Ambassador Programme (SAP) aims to transform our students into confident young ambassadors for Singapore.</p>
<p>We have two partner schools and each school has its own niche area which our students are able to benefit from the immersion programme. Our partner schools are Wuxi Jinqiao Bilingual Experimental School in Wuxi and St. Francis of Assisi English Primary School in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The SAP is targeted at Primary Five students. Each candidate has to go through a structured training programme which consists of the centralized training modules online, interviews, customized group training and the overseas learning journey.<br />The SAP programme do not end upon returning, students&nbsp;would have to participate in post trip activities to share their learning experiences abroad. They are also required to take on post trip project to impact their school mates.</p>

<h4><strong>Friends4Life</strong></h4>

<p>The inbound Friends-For-Life is the reciprocating programme for the school&rsquo;s outbound Student Ambassador Programme. The duration is dependent on each partner school&rsquo;s arrangement. In Friends-For-Life, students get to host and build friendships with students of the partner schools through interactive activities. It also allows school staff to have exchanges to share pedagogical experiences and resources.</p>
