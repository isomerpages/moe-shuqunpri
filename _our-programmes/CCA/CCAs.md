<p><strong>Co-curricular activities (CCA)</strong>&nbsp;form an integral part of the school&rsquo;s objective to provide an all-round education for our pupils. As such, every pupil from P3 onwards is required to participate in one CCA during his/her primary school years. The CCA was organised and implemented to fuel in the individual a lifelong love for a particular activity. The CCA schedule has been built into the school overall plan to ensure that all P3 to P6 students participate in one CCA.</p>
<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3><p>Every Child acquires Sports/Aesthetic skills and values. as part of Holistic Development.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>We are committed to providing opportunities for our pupils to discover, develop and excel their interest in Sports/Aesthetics through CCA.</p>
