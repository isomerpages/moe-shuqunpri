<div>
<p>The National Physical Fitness Assessment (NAPFA) test was introduced in Singapore schools in 1982 at the secondary and pre-university levels and in 1992 at the primary level. Since 1992, the percentage of students passing the NAPFA has been used as an indicator of the fitness level of our student population. The design of the test items in the NAPFA test has evolved and the norms have been updated regularly. NAPFA is compulsory for P4 and P6 students.</p>
<p><strong>Test Stations</strong></p>
<p>NAPFA involves a series of five stations and 1.6 km Run. The first 5 station tests are attempted on one day, with a 2- 5 minute rest period permitted between stations while the 1.6 km Run is attempted on another day with at least 2 days rest interval.</p>
