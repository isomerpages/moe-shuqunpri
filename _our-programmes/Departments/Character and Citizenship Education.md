<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mission</span></strong></h3>
<p>To nurture every Shuqunite into a confident leader, with sound character who contributes<br />actively to the community.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Programmes</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>1) Values Education</strong></p>
<p>Values Education is anchored on the school&rsquo;s ICARE values and it is the cornerstone of Citizenship and Character Education . It strives to strengthen&nbsp;each&nbsp;Shuqunite&rsquo;s ICARE identity of serving peers, school and community with quality, by engaging students in a myriad of platforms such as storytelling, newspaper articles, skit, video clips, books display and reflective journal writing.</p>
<p><strong>2) Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong></p>
<p>Values-In-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students&rsquo; development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA in SQPS fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p><strong>3) Play And Learn @ SQ</strong></p>
<p>Play And Learn @SQ which is our Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for our lower primary students that provides a broad exposure of experiences to our pupils in the domains of Sport &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It offers a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school, and facilitates holistic and well-rounded development of the students. It emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. One of the main features of PAL is the emphasis on inculcating values and developing social and emotional competencies. Values remain essential to shape the person&rsquo;s beliefs, attitudes and actions in whatever type of world the child finds himself in.</p>
<p><strong>4) NE Nuggets</strong></p>
<p>NE Nuggets promote a culture of informed, concerned and participative citizenship, students are engaged through just in time and bite-sized packages on current social , regional and global issues . The information and discussions provide opportunities for students to be reflective global citizens who make a positive impact on the lives of others and the environment. All NE nugget segments are planned with 3 critical features :1. Strengthening Identity 2. Fostering good relations 3. Focusing on Choices for Actions.</p>
