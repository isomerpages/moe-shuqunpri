<p><strong>1. ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy)</strong></p>
<p>ICAN is an intervention programme to help the low-progress learner build up their numeracy skills and confidence in Mathematics. It aims to bridge student&rsquo;s learning gap by providing more scaffolding and focusing on the language and memory</p>
<p><strong>2. LSM (Learning Support for Mathematics)</strong></p>
<p>LSM programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics learning. This programme targets Primary 1 and 2 students who have not achieved an age-appropriate mathematical age when they enter Primary school. Identified students are supported by a trained teacher. Through smaller class size and appropriate pedagogies, the students will receive the necessary support to develop their numeracy skills.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>1. E2K (Excellence 2000)</strong></p>
<p>This programme is designed to provide students a structured approach to mathematical thinking and mathematical communication. In addition, there are opportunities for your child/ward to develop abilities for independent learning and love of learning. During the sessions, different forms of games, stories and puzzles will be used to engage your child/ward in problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>2. Math Olympiad Training and Competition</strong></p>
