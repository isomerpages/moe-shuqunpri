<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shuqun Primary School Football CCA aims to develop students through the core values of discipline, hard work, and teamwork. Training sessions are structured to instil discipline, teaching students to follow rules, respect teachers, coaches and fellow peers through effective communication skills. Students are encouraged to work hard collectively as they learn and practice basic football skills, improve their physical fitness, and challenge themselves to improve, harnessing their leadership&nbsp;skills along the way. Through critical thinking, students support one another and work together towards shared goals. Eventually, students grow not only as athletes but also as confident, respectful, and resilient individuals.</p>
