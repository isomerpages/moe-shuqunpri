<p>Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops them in 5 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal &amp; Social Development – Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured Me</li>
<li>Home – Home Safety &amp; Duties</li>
<li>Outdoor – Discovering Nature, A Green World</li>
<li>Community – My Country, My Neighbourhood, Helper</li>

</ul>
<p>Through games, outdoor activities, and hands-on projects, Brownies develop important life skills like teamwork, leadership, and creativity. Brownies will also get to learn other necessary skills through camps, field trips, fun activities and appropriate tasks or projects to help them acquire their proficiency badges.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Girls' Brigade (GB), we seek to develop each girl to her fullest potential by equipping her with the necessary skills, empowering her to make good decisions and fostering a sense of responsibility towards the community. There are abundant opportunities for the girls to form supportive friendships and acquire leadership skills through fun-filled and meaningful activities such as camps, national activities and community involvement projects. Through these activities, they will also earn their proficiency badges when certain skills are displayed. GB CCA sessions are held every Saturday morning.</p>
