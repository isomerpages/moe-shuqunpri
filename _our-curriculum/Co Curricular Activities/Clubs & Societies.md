<p>The Media Production House (MPH) equips students with essential digital and creative skills through hands-on programs in photography, video editing, and multimedia production. These programs foster creativity and critical thinking, helping students gain confidence in creating and presenting multimedia work.</p>
<p>In 2025, MPH ran courses in New Media, Video Editing and photography to help students build technical skills and self-confidence. Additionally, the MPH supports the school by providing photography services at school events, giving students real-world experience and a sense of professionalism.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2026, MPH will be partnering with new industry vendors to offer exciting new courses in Paper Cut Stop Motion Animation, Photography &amp; Editing as well as Digital Animation to prepare students for the future.</p>


<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Green Club</span></strong></h3>
<p>Members of the Green Club will learn about environmental issues particularly on awareness of the 3Rs and understanding of the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife and the environment through hands-on and experiential learning. They have many opportunities to advocate for environmental issues both within and outside the school. They also participate in gardening and bird watching activities.</p>


<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Library Club</span></strong></h3>
<p>Students with a love for reading and a passion for activities related to books are most welcomed at the Library CCA Club. We have different activities throughout the year, introducing students to new books, marketing of books, researching on thematic displays for the library and even performing items like Reader's Theatre and Storytelling. In addition, students go on Treasure Hunts in school and on learning journeys outside of school too!</p>
