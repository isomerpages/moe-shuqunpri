<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sports and Wellness Fiesta</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Sports and Wellness Fiesta is an annual event that aims to promote both mental the physical well-being of the students through a variety of sports and physical activities. It is part of the school&rsquo;s effort to develop the students holistically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Students are exposed to a range of indoor and outdoor activities, such as bouldering and orienteering, which would give them the opportunity to pick up a new activity or skill. To promote healthy competition among their peers and a sense of belonging to their respective classes, students would accumulate points for their class when participating in the activities.</span></p>
