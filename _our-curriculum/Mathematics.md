<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Mission</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To develop competency and nurture passion in mathematical problem solving for the daily life application.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Key Programmes</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Math lessons are delivered using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach. To introduce a Mathematical concept, teachers use manipulatives to provide hands-on learning experiences. This age-appropriate approach also provide scaffolding for the primary students to help them grasp abstract mathematical concepts. The concrete manipulatives will be followed by pictorial representations. Finally, the students will move on to the abstract representation in the form of mathematical symbols and equations.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>LSM (Learning Support for Mathematics)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">LSM programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics learning. This programme targets Primary 1 to Primary 3 students who have not achieved baseline numeracy skills in the level. Identified students are supported by a trained teacher. Through smaller class size and appropriate pedagogies, the students will receive the necessary support to develop their numeracy skills.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Math Activities and Displays</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To increase students&rsquo; interest in learning Mathematics, the school uses its Math walls and notice boards to engage students with Math application in daily life, as well as Math quizzes. In addition, the school also conduct Math competitions such as poster and game design competition as well as ICT quizzes.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Enrichment Programmes</span></strong></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>E2K (Excellence 2000)</strong></span></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This programme is designed to provide the students a structured approach to mathematical thinking and mathematical communication. In addition, there are opportunities to develop abilities for independent learning and love of learning. Different forms of games, stories and puzzles are used to engage the students in problem solving.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Math Olympiad Training and Competition</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students with high aptitude and attitude in Mathematics will be selected for Math Olympiad training sessions. These sessions will prepare the participants for national Mathematics competitions.</span></p>
