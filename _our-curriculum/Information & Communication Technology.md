<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Mission</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To develop a conducive environment in teaching and learning for every student and staff to become intelligent and responsible users of ICT.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Desired Outcomes for Students</strong></span></h4>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Cyber-healthy students who are discerning users of ICT guided by the right values and attitudes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Active learners who are able to think critically and problem solve creatively.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Confident citizens/residents who can contribute and serve the country with a heart.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">ICT in Shuqun</span></strong></h3>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ICT in Teaching and Learning</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ICT is integrated across various subjects to engage students and increase efficacy so that students can deepen learning and go through meaningful learning experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">ICT baseline skills needed to enable these ICT integrated lessons are embedded in the curriculum through various ways e.g. SLS lessons, ICT tips and quizzes, face-to-face lessons and so on, for the different levels.&nbsp; The progressive skill sets for the levels are chosen to suit the students&rsquo; ability and level of readiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To help our lower primary students acclimatize to primary school and acquire the necessary ICT skills, we have customized programmes like touch-typing (English Language) and iPad trail (Mother Tongue Languages) to kick-start their learning journey in Shuqun.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To allow the students to have more opportunities to further hone their ICT skills, the school has also arranged for fun filled activities outside the classroom.&nbsp; For example, students can test their typing skills by competing with each other through the touch-typing competitions.&nbsp; During the PSLE period, students get to encourage and show care to their graduating seniors/peers by sending their well-wishes through a common platform linked by SLS. They can use various ICT skills learnt from enrichment programmes to either record videos, design e-cards or simply type messages and posting them in SLS.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Cyber Wellness Education</strong></span></h4>

![](/images/CyberWellness%201.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behavior and awareness of how to protect oneself in the online space. The focus of CW is to help students to become safe and responsible digital learners. It is important for students to be equipped with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to demonstrate respect for self and others, and to practice safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence and harness the power of technology for the good of the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;The CW framework shown above guides schools in planning for an inclusive programme to ensure students become intelligent and responsible users of ICT.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSA)</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">To help champion our Cyber Wellness efforts, CWSA undergo a series of training by our CW teachers to equip them with the necessary CW and leadership skills.&nbsp; The CWSA are expected to harness what they have learnt and positively influence their peers in school, carry out duties at CW/ICT events and share presentations on current CW issues during Student Teacher Contact Time (STCT).&nbsp; Together with their CW teachers, the CWSA also produces CW videos to share useful CW tips.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Cyber Wellness for Students</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Various platforms are provided for students to acquire and apply their CW skills :</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;">FTGP lessons</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Termly CW lessons (STCT)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Assemblies (differentiated)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Safer Internet Day</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Cyber Wellness for Parents</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">We believe that &ldquo;it takes a village to raise a child&rdquo;.&nbsp; We believe in working with parents to further strengthen the CW issues taught in school.&nbsp; Parents are updated on the various CW issues via SPEC, a sharing from various departments, conducted yearly or through term letters.&nbsp; The school website also has useful links for parents to find out more about any relevant CW or ICT concerns that they might have.</span></p>
