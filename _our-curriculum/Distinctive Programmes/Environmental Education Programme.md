<p>Shuqun&rsquo;s Green Plan is a school wide approach to educate students with skills to solve global environmental problems we face. We want them to be responsible to the environment which they live in. The Environment Education curriculum is developed by teachers with the aim to educate our students on environmental challenges and raise awareness that our everyday actions impact our environment sustainability.<br />This curriculum focuses on six key areas of conservation. &nbsp;The students will engage in active discussion on the various environmental and conservation challenges such as climate change. Through active learning, students can learn to be more proactive and become next generation of conservation leaders. The lessons and discussions are aimed&nbsp;&nbsp;to broaden and deepen students&rsquo; level of environmental knowledge so that they can transfer their learning into positive environmental actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shuqun Primary&rsquo;s Environmental Education Policy</strong></p>
<p>It is important for the Shuqun Primary community to have an awareness and understanding of its actions on the environment in which we learn, work, play and interact. We must make it our goal to make responsible choices and demonstrate a duty of care to the lives of others, living things and the environment around us.</p>
<p>The way in which we will strive towards this goal is to reduce wastage, reuse materials which can be restored and recycle materials that can be used for various purposes and participate in environmental education activities.</p>
<p>As members of the Shuqun Primary community,</p>
<p>1. We will switch off all fans and lights when not in use.<br />2. We will turn off taps when they are not in use.<br />3. We will not litter.<br />4. We will reduce the amount of paper we use and ensure both sides of the paper are fully used before we dispose them.<br />5.
