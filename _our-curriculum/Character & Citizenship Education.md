<p><span style="color: #000000;">Character and Citizenship Education, including National Education and Social Emotional Learning, is integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Shuqun Primary, the CCE experience is customised based on the 3Es approach &ndash; Engage, Enrich and Excite through the CCE Curriculum and school-customised programmes. In cultivating a caring and enabling learning environment, student voice and ownership is encouraged to cater to our students&rsquo; interests. Students would feel included and empowered as we acknowledge their views and ideas. With that, we hope that Shuqunites will be motivated to contribute positively and strive towards excellence.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Character Education</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The CCE curriculum content is premised on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and anchored on the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies. Students are taken through structured lessons and activities to equip them with necessary skills and knowledge including 21st century competencies for their personal and social growth.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students are engaged in &lsquo;Talk and Reflect&rsquo; through discussions during lessons. Opportunities are provided for students to express themselves and make sense of what they learn by reflection. &nbsp;CCE FTGP lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Character and Citizenship Education Mother Tongue Language (CCE MTL)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A variety of activities such as cultural stories, songs, proverbs and practices are used in CCE MTL lessons to deepen the learning of moral values. The questions and activities help students relate to the stories, songs, and cultural practices that are set in different contexts. Students reflect on the values learnt and apply the learning in their lives.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Educational Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Shuqun Primary, we invite our partners such as PSG, SAC and Alumni members to share on their occupations during event such as Total Defence Day. Students gain an insight in occupations which are related to the six pillars of defence. ECG sharing on the different educational pathway as well as different occupations by our alumni members is also part of our post PSLE activity for the Primary 6 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Through ECG lessons conducted during CCE FTGP, students are equipped with the knowledge, skills and values to help them make informed education and career choices, empowering them for lifelong learning. Upper Primary students get to access My SkillsFuture portal that helps them start on a journey of self-discovery. Through the use of the information and tools, students find out what they want to do when they grow up, learn about the choices on hand and set goals towards their ambitions!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">SEd lessons are taught during CCE FTGP lessons at Primary 5 and 6. This programme aims to help our students develop positive self-identities and healthy relationships and make responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for our lower primary students provides a broad exposure of experiences to our students in the domains of Sport &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. PAL contributes to the development of dispositions in our students such as having a lively curiosity about the world they live in, the ability to cooperate with others, and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Values Education</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Values Education is anchored on the school&rsquo;s ICARE values and it is the cornerstone of Citizenship and Character Education. It strives to strengthen&nbsp;each&nbsp;Shuqunite&rsquo;s ICARE identity of serving peers, school and community, striving to contribute positively and making a positive difference. The learning of values is reinforced through lessons on current social, regional and global issues. The information and discussions provide opportunities for students to be reflective global citizens who make a positive impact on the lives of others and the environment. Students are engaged through a myriad of platforms such as stories, newspaper articles, skits, video clips, books display and reflections.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Values-In-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students&rsquo; development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA in SQPS fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community such as participating in food donation drive. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can contribute meaningfully. Besides serving the needs of the community, students have opportunities to learn about Everyday Responsibilities within the CCE curriculum. Students develop a sense of responsibility and care for the shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting practices in school and at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Other school customised programmes include &ldquo;I Am a Buddy&rdquo; programme which provides an opportunity for the Primary Four students to take care of their little brothers and sisters in Primary One at the start of the year. Our Primary Six students will be engaged in Bizkids, a social entrepreneurship project. It is a platform for students to raise funds while learning about environmental sustainability.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>CCE Ambassadors</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our ambassadors are student leaders who promote Character and Citizenship values through school programmes. They engage and lead their peers in class, level, school and student-initiated community projects as part of their leadership development. Our CCE ambassadors adopt the five practices of exemplary leadership model in the planning and implementation of CCE activities which they initiate. &nbsp;Some activities include involvement in NE commemorative events, sharing of school values and organising the Non-Teaching Staff Appreciation Day.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Citizenship Education</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>National Education (NE) Events</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">National Education comprises four core annual events that we commemorate as a school. The Commemorative Days are linked to defining moments in Singapore's history. Learning activities are customised to create a holistic learning experience for our students. They will engage in various activities to understand the significance of each event and reflect on their importance in Singapore as well as themselves as Singaporeans. As part of the National Education programme, all Primary 5 students will also be scheduled to attend the National Education Show (NE Show) which is a special preview of the National Day Parade. Through this Learning Journey, students learn to appreciate the significance of National Day.</span></p>
