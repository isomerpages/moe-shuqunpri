<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Mission</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Shuqun Primary School, the CCE experience is customised based on the 3Es approach &ndash; Engage, Enrich and Excite through the CCE Curriculum and school-customised programmes. In cultivating a caring and enabling learning environment, student voice and ownership is encouraged to cater to our students&rsquo; interests. Students would feel included and empowered as we acknowledge their views and ideas. With that, we hope that Shuqunites will be motivated to contribute positively and strive for excellence.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Key Programmes</span></strong></h3>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Character Education</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The CCE curriculum content is premised on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and anchored on the teaching of core values and social-emotional competencies. Students are taken through structured lessons and activities to equip them with necessary skills and knowledge including 21st century competencies for their personal and social growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With the school adopting Positive Education (PosEd) as a whole-school approach, academic learning is infused with character and student well-being. Within PosEd, we aim to develop students&rsquo; well-being in terms of having personal effectiveness, positive emotions and relationships which are developed through reinforcement of social-emotional competencies within the CCE curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Programmes include:</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students are engaged in &lsquo;Talk and Reflect&rsquo; through discussions during lessons. Form Teachers use a variety of facilitation strategies to conduct student discussions in class and help students develop key traits such as critical thinking, empathy and perspective-taking. Opportunities are provided for students to express themselves and make sense of what they learn by reflection. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">CCE FTGP lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of social-emotional skills which are anchored in values and citizenship dispositions. Form teachers carry out various lessons including peer support relationships, student leadership, termly check-ins, Growth Mindset and goal-setting lessons during CCE FTGP. The activities, reflections and discussions during these lessons help encourage establish positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Character and Citizenship Education Mother Tongue Language (CCE MTL)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A variety of activities such as cultural stories, songs, proverbs and practices are used in CCE MTL lessons to deepen the learning of moral values. The questions and activities help students relate to the stories, songs, and cultural practices that are set in different contexts. Students reflect on the values learnt and apply the learning in their lives.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Educational Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In Shuqun Primary School, we invite our partners such as PSG, SAC and Alumni members to share on their occupations during event such as Total Defence Day. Students gain insights into occupations which are related to the six pillars of defence. ECG sharing sessions on the different educational pathways as well as different occupations by our alumni members is also part of our post-PSLE programme for the Primary 6 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Through ECG lessons conducted during CCE FTGP, students are equipped with the knowledge, skills and values to help them make informed education and career choices, empowering them for lifelong learning. Upper Primary students get to access My SkillsFuture portal that helps them start on a journey of self-discovery. Through the use of the information and tools, students find out what they want to do when they grow up; learn about the choices on hand and set goals towards their fulfilling their ambitions!</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong></span></h4>

<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for our lower primary students provides a broad exposure of experiences to our students in the domains of Sport &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. PAL emphasises learning through hands-on experiences; having fun and enjoyment in the learning and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. PAL contributes to the development of dispositions in our students such as having a lively curiosity about the world they live in; the ability to cooperate with others and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Values Education</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Values Education is anchored on the school&rsquo;s ICARE values and it is the cornerstone of Citizenship and Character Education. Here in Shuqun Primary School, we seek to ground all students in values and develop them to have a heart to serve. Our Values Education programme strives to strengthen&nbsp;each&nbsp;Shuqunite&rsquo;s ICARE identity of serving peers, school and community as ways of contributing positively to benefit others. The learning of values is reinforced through lessons on current social, regional and global issues. The information and discussions provide opportunities for students to be reflective global citizens who make a positive impact on the lives of others and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">During ICARE lessons, students get to express their views and suggestions, making a choice to care for the community through polls and various activities. Students are also engaged through a myriad of platforms such as stories, newspaper articles, skits, video clips, books display and reflections. Through our ICARE lessons, we hope that students are more aware of contemporary issues and explore what they can do to make a positive difference.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Values-In-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support the students&rsquo; development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA in Shuqun Primary School fosters student ownership of how they would like to contribute to the community such as participating in food donation drives. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice and how they can contribute meaningfully. Besides serving the needs of the community, students have opportunities to learn about Everyday Responsibilities within the CCE curriculum. Students develop a sense of responsibility and care for the shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting practices in school and at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Other school customised programmes include &ldquo;I Am a Buddy&rdquo; programme which provides an opportunity for the Primary Four students to take care of their little brothers and sisters in Primary One at the start of the year. Our Primary Six students are engaged in Bizkids, a social entrepreneurship project, as a post-PSLE project. It is a platform for students to raise funds while learning about environmental sustainability.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>CCE Ambassadors</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our ambassadors are student leaders who promote Character and Citizenship values through school programmes. They engage and lead their peers in class, level, school and student-initiated community projects as part of their leadership development. Our CCE ambassadors adopt the five practices of exemplary leadership model in the planning and implementation of CCE activities which they initiate. &nbsp;Some activities include involvement in NE commemorative events, sharing of school values and organising the Non-Teaching Staff Appreciation Day.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Citizenship Education</span></strong></h3>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>National Education (NE) Events</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">National Education comprises four core annual events &ndash; Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, that we commemorate as a school. The commemorative days are linked to defining moments in Singapore's history. Learning activities are customised to create a holistic learning experience for our students. They engage in various activities to understand the significance of each event and reflect on their importance in Singapore as well as for themselves as Singaporeans. As part of the National Education programme, all Primary 5 students will also be scheduled to attend the National Education Show (NE Show) which is a special preview of the National Day Parade. Through this Learning Journey, students learn to appreciate the significance of National Day.</span></p>
