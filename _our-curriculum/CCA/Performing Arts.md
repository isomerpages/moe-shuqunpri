<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Through weekly sessions, members of the Art Club explore various mediums and genres of Art. For example, observational drawing, digital art, oil pastel, watercolour, and even clay work. These art tasks act as a platform for Art Club members to enhance their creativity and self-expression, enabling them to have better understanding of the elements of art and principles of design. By exposing them to competitions and exhibitions, we hope to instill in Art Club members self-confidence, resilience as well as deeper appreciation for the different art forms.</span></p>
