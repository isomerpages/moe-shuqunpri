One of the highlights in this CCA is the Stop-motion workshop where members work in groups to create a story-based animation.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Library Club</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Students with a love for reading and a passion for activities related to books are most welcomed at the Library CCA Club. We have different activities throughout the year, introducing students to new books, marketing of books, researching on thematic displays for the library and even performing items like Reader's Theatre and Storytelling. In addition, students go on Treasure Hunts in school and on learning journeys outside of school too!</span></p>
