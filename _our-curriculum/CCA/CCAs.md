<p><span style="color: #000000;">Co-curricular activities (CCA)&nbsp;form an integral part of the school&rsquo;s objective to provide a holistic education for our students. As such, every student from Primary 3 onwards is required to participate in one CCA during his/her primary school years. The CCA was organised and implemented to develop 21st century competencies (21CC) of the students.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mission</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are committed to providing opportunities for our pupils to discover, develop and excel their interest and character through CCA.</span></p>
