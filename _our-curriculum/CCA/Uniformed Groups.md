<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Brownies</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are various activities that allow our Brownies to explore and discover the world around them and become more independent. While they learn to work independently, they also acquire skills that enable them to function effectively in teams. Along the way, they learn to care for one another as well as others around them thus building lasting friendships.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Girls' Brigade</span></strong></h3>


<p style="text-align: justify;">In Girls' Brigade (GB), we seek to develop each girl to her fullest potential by equipping her with the necessary skills, empowering her to make good decisions and fostering a sense of responsibility towards the community. There are abundant opportunities for the girls to form supportive friendships and acquire leadership skills through fun-filled and meaningful activities such as camps, national activities and community involvement projects. Through these activities, they will also earn their proficiency badges when certain skills are displayed. GB CCA sessions are held every Saturday morning.</p>

They will participate in activities such as BB Enrolment Day, BB Week, BB Cares and various camps.
