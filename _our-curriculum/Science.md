<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mission</strong></span></h3>
<p>Nurture effective and creative thinkers with a sense of inquiry and passion for the learning of science</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key&nbsp;Programmes</strong></span></h3>
<p>Science curriculum at SQPS adopts the pedagogy of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) in the teaching and learning of Science. Students are provided with opportunities to engage in meaningful learning of key scientific ideas as they are taken through the 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model &ndash; Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. Through active learning, students acquire the skills to synthesize knowledge, transfer their learning in varied contexts and make connections with their surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>1. Integration of Science with Stellar</strong></p>
<p>This programme is mainly integrated into the teaching of English in Primary 1 and Primary 2. It taps on the natural curiosity of our young learners to develop their Science concepts and skills. Students get to learn simple science concepts and facts which are weaved into the Stellar units through interactive and fun activities.</p>
<p><strong>2. High Progress Enrichment Programme</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the core Science curriculum, selected students with high aptitude from Primary 3 to Primary 5 undergo a customised Science Enrichment Programme conducted by our teachers. The contents covered in this programme extend beyond the basic syllabus and students are engaged in scientific inquiry as they conduct research and experiments involving more advanced science concepts.</p>
<p><strong>3. Every Child a Seed</strong></p>
<p>To complement the Primary 3 syllabus, Every Child a Seed programme provide the opportunity for our students to experience the process of growing their own plants. Students not only learn about the life cycle of plants, plant parts and their functions, our school&rsquo;s ICARE values (care and responsibility) are also reinforced.</p>
<p><strong>4. Lessons at Science Centre</strong></p>
<p>Learning of Science extends beyond the classrooms. Students from P3 to P5 attend lessons at the Science Centre targeted at selected topics within the syllabus.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Environmental Education</strong></span></h3>
<p>Aligned to Shuqun&rsquo;s strategic thrust &lsquo;Service to Community&rsquo; and as part of the school-wide approach towards our Shuqun Green Plan, Environmental Education (EE) modules, which are part of the school-based Science curriculum, &nbsp;aim to educate our students on environmental challenges and to nurture young minds in building a greener future.</p>
<p>The EE curriculum aims to achieve the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate students about environmental challenges and civic responsibility</li>
<li>Inspire students to be leaders who take positive actions in leading a sustainable environment</li>
<li>Provide an opportunity for staff and students to embrace an eco-friendly lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>The EE framework is primarily made up of the four main domains that align the school&rsquo;s environmental initiatives and programmes to the outcomes of EE curriculum.</p>

<p>Through the 3A approach namely &lsquo;Awareness&rsquo;, &lsquo;Actions&rsquo; and &lsquo;Advocacy&rsquo;, we hope that EE programme deepen our students&rsquo; level of environmental knowledge so that they can transfer their learning into positive environmental actions.&nbsp; Through active learning, students can learn to be more proactive and are able to advocate through their actions the importance of environment conservation.</p>
