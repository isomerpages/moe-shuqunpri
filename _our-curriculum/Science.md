<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Mission</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nurture self-directed and creative thinkers with a sense of inquiry and passion for the learning of science</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Key Programmes</span></strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Science curriculum at Shuqun Primary School seeks to nurture Shuqunites to be scientifically literate so that they are able to appreciate the role of Science in daily life and the environment around them.&nbsp; We hope to inspire students to enjoy learning science and have the passion to inquire and innovate to solve real-world problems. Through a myriad of meaningful learning experiences facilitated by our teachers, we hope to ignite and fuel their curiosity for the learning of Science.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">As a Green school, we work towards nurturing all Shuqunites to become responsible citizens who show care for the environment around them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Various ICT tools and online learning platforms are used to enhance Science teaching and learning and increase students&rsquo; engagement as well as having ownership of learning. ICT lesson packages are curated and made accessible to students via SLS.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Outdoor Learning Spaces </strong></span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The department seeks to enhance students learning of science using the natural and physical environment in the school as the 3<sup>rd</sup> teacher.&nbsp; Our Green Spaces complement the teaching and learning of the science curriculum; it provides the avenue for students to engage in hands-on learning to nurture their care for the environment. Through our Greens@Shuqun programme, students learn to grow, observe plants growth until the crops are ready to be harvested and consumed. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Use of Sparkle Kits </strong></span></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">E2K Science Programme is conducted for Primary 4 and 5 who demonstrate high aptitude and interest in Science. The E2K lessons are designed to engage students in scientific investigations to enhance their scientific thinking dispositions and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills. The contents covered in this programme extend beyond the basic syllabus and students are engaged in scientific inquiry as they conduct research and experiments involving more advanced science concepts.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lessons at Science Centre </strong></span></h4>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Learning of Science extends beyond the classrooms. Students from Primary 3 to 5 attend lessons at the Science Centre targeted at selected topics within the syllabus.</span></p>
