<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Learning Journey to a Theatre Production</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The school develops a structure to ensure that every student is given the opportunity to watch a public musical, dance or drama performance at least once in primary school years. Prior to the attending the performance, students get to learn about theatre etiquette. As a post-event activity, students pen down their learning experiences through a journal reflection.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Aesthetics Assembly Programmes</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Quality arts assembly programmes are scheduled to expose the students to a wide range of art forms. Assembly showcases by professional artists and arts groups such as Acapella group, Caricature Drawing and Beatboxing have been inspirational to the students. Outreach talks are also conducted for our Primary 5 and 6 students who are talented in Arts so that they are aware of the different alternatives secondary school path.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong></span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lower Primary Music Enrichments</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Primary 2 students are given a choice to go through different music enrichment programmes after-school. Violin and Brass Band enrichments are conducted&nbsp;to allow the young enthusiasts to start learning the music instrument before they start their CCAs in Primary 3.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lower Primary Museum Visit</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Selected lower primary students who show interest and talent in art are involved in the guided tour at the Singapore Art Museum or the Philatelic Museum. Via the museum and gallery visits, students learn about Singapore&rsquo;s culture, its heritage as well as appreciate how art is involved in the creation of the artefacts.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Exhibitions and Competitions</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students have the opportunities to participate in art exhibitions and competitions organised by both the school and other external organisations. In collaboration with National Library Board (NLB) and Princess Elizabeth Primary School, the Joint-School Art Exhibition provides a platform for our students to showcase their artworks in a public space. They also facilitate in an art workshop for the young children and their parents.</span></p>
